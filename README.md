## How It Works

### 1. Authentication

Users sign in via Puter.js authentication, which provides a secure cloud storage space for each user.

### 2. Resume Upload

- User uploads a PDF resume via drag-and-drop
- Resume is uploaded to Puter.js cloud storage
- PDF is converted to an image for preview using `pdfjs-dist`
- Image is also uploaded to cloud storage

### 3. AI Analysis

- User provides job details (company, title, description)
- Application sends resume + job context to Puter.js AI API (Claude model)
- AI analyzes the resume across 5 dimensions:
  - ATS compatibility
  - Tone and style
  - Content quality
  - Structure
  - Skills alignment

### 4. Feedback Storage

- Analysis results are stored in Puter.js Key-Value store
- Each resume gets a unique UUID
- Data structure:
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string,
    resumePath: string,      // Cloud path to PDF
    imagePath: string,       // Cloud path to preview image
    companyName: string,
    jobTitle: string,
    jobDescription: string,
    feedback: Feedback       // AI analysis results
  }
  ```

### 5. Dashboard & Review

- Users can view all their submitted resumes
- Click on any resume to see detailed feedback
- Side-by-side view of resume and AI suggestions

## Environment Setup

### Puter.js Configuration

This application uses Puter.js SDK, which is loaded via CDN in the HTML. No API keys are required for basic usage, but you need to:

1. **Sign up** at [puter.com](https://puter.com)
2. **Sign in** when prompted in the application
3. Your cloud storage and AI quota are managed by Puter.js

### Custom Configuration (Optional)

If you want to modify the AI model or prompts:

1. Edit `constants/index.ts` to customize the AI instructions
2. Modify the model in `app/lib/puter.ts` (line 354):
   ```typescript
   {
     model: "claude-sonnet-4.5";
   } // Change to other supported models
   ```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

A `Dockerfile` is included for containerized deployment:

```bash
docker build -t ai-resume-analyser .
docker run -p 3000:3000 ai-resume-analyser
```

### Static Hosting

Since this is a React Router application, you can deploy to:

- **Vercel**
- **Netlify**
- **Cloudflare Pages**
- **GitHub Pages**

Build the app first:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then deploy the `build/` directory to your hosting provider.
